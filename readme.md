This cat clearly forgot to lint her CSS before deployment:

Don't be like that cat.

## Installation

```bash
npm install stylelint-config-bigchaindb
```

## Usage

### Setup

Add this to your `.stylelintrc` file:

```json
{
    "extends": "stylelint-config-bigchaindb"
}
```

If you really know what you're doingâ„¢ you can change or disable individual rules globally in your project:

```json
{
    "extends": "stylelint-config-bigchaindb",
    "rules": {
        "selector-max-id": 1,
        "selector-no-qualifying-type": null
    }
}
```

Or disable blocks inline in your css:

```scss
/* stylelint-disable selector-list-comma-newline-after  */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6,
.h1, .h2, .h3, .h4, .h5, .h6 {
    color: $that-pink-which-burns-my-eyes;
}
/* stylelint-enable */
```

In general, try to never disable anything. Every time you disable even one rule one of those creatures gets killed:

### Linting

Use `stylelint` against your css files, e.g.:

```bash
stylelint *.scss
```

Or lint in your editor with one of the many editor plugins for [stylelint](https://stylelint.io), e.g. for Atom:

```bash
apm install linter-stylelint
```

## npm releases

For a new **patch release**, execute on the machine where you're logged into your npm account:

```bash
npm run release
```

Command is powered by [`release-it`](https://github.com/webpro/release-it) package, defined in the `package.json`.

That's what the command does without any user interaction:

- create release commit by updating version in `package.json`
- create tag for that release commit
- push commit & tag
- create a new release on GitHub, with change log auto-generated from commit messages
- publish to npm as a new release

If you want to create a **minor** or **major release**, use these commands:

```bash
npm run release-minor
```

```bash
npm run release-major
```
