This cat clearly forgot to lint her CSS before deployment:

Don't be like that cat.

## Installation

```bash
npm install stylelint-config-bigchaindb
```

## Usage

Add this to your `.stylelintrc` file:

```json
{
    "extends": "stylelint-config-bigchaindb"
}
```

Then use `stylelint` against your css files, e.g.:

```bash
stylelint *.scss
```

Or lint in your editor with one of the many editor plugins for [stylelint](https://stylelint.io), e.g. for Atom:

```bash
apm install linter-stylelint
```

## npm releases

For a new release, execute on the machine where you're logged into your npm account:

```bash
npm run release
```

This should suffice for most updates but be aware this always creates a patch update. Command is powered by [`release-it`](https://github.com/webpro/release-it) package. That's what the command does:

- create release commit
- create tag for that release commit
- push commit & tag
- create a new release on GitHub
- publish to npm

If you want to create a minor or major update, use these commands:

```bash
npm run release-minor
```

```bash
npm run release-major
```
